# lv_binding_cpp

C++ binding for LVGL.

We find this binging very important and can sponsor its development.  We can give 400 USD for someone who creates a C++ binding which is 
- mostly auto generated
- can have minor manually written parts
- documented (the binding and the API too)
- code example is added to at least 15 existing examples

Please open an issue if you are interested in it.
